Unlike\nstandard rm, which permanently deletes files, roxide safely moves them to a\ndesignated \"`trash`\" directory. This approach enables efficient and fast file\nremoval without risking unintended data loss.\n\n**Note**: I am an amateur Rust programmer, so while this code might not be the\nmost refined, it prioritizes safety and has been thoroughly tested. If you have\nideas for improvement or notice any issues, contributions are very welcome! This\nproject is open to suggestions, code reviews, and pull requests from developers\nof all experience levels.\n\n## Getting started\n\n- `roxide file.txt`: files will moved to `trash dir`. ie,\n  $HOME/.local/share/Trash/files/\n- `roxide revert` : restores perviously removed file/directory to its pervious\n  path\n- `roxide -r | --recursive` : Remove directories and their contents recursively\n- `roxide -f | --force` : Remove without moving to trash directory\n- `roxide -v | --verbose` : will print the file name and its out path\n- `roxide some/dir/ -p .pdf`: will remove files matching the pattern from\n  some/dir\n- `roxide some/dir/ -rp .pdf`: will recursively remove files matching the\n  pattern from some/dir\n- `roxide some/dir/ -rp .pdf -l`: will list files, like dry run\n- `roxide some/* -i never`: will never prompt\n- `roxide some/* -i once`: Prompt once before removing more than three files or\n  when removing recursivly\n- `roxide some/* -i always`: Prompt before every removal\n- `roxide some/* -p .pdf -i always`: Prompt before every removal\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> 1. Do not use sudo. Support for sudo is still work in progress.\n> 2. It wont warn about write protected contents (wip)\n> 3.

      "content_html": "RSS is a powerful way to stay updated with your favorite blogs, social media\nchannels, and other online content without being distracted by endless scrolling\non the actual platforms. [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/), a terminal-based RSS\nreader, is an excellent tool for this.\n\nIn this post, I'll guide you through how to set up your newsboat configuration\nusing Nix functions to generate RSS feeds from platforms like YouTube, Twitter,\nReddit, Instagram, and Spotify with less boilerplates. For more informations on\nsupported platforms visit [rsshub](https://rsshub.netlify.app/).\n\n# Setting Up Nix Functions for RSS Feeds\n\n# Nix Functions\n\nIn Nix, functions are written as follows:\n\n#### Single parameter\n\n```nix\nparam1: {\n    # Function Body\n}\n```\n\n#### Two parameters\n\n```nix\nparam1: param2: {\n    # Function Body\n}\n```\n\nHere, param1, param2, and so on are the inputs (arguments) to the function. This\nallows you to write reusable functions where you only need to provide specific\ndata, such as a username or unique ID, and the function handles the boilerplate\nparts of the links.\n\nYou might notice that functions in Nix don’t have a name. Nix functions are\nsimilar to closures in Rust, This means you can’t call them directly by name,\nthey are anonymous. To use them, you must bind the function to a variable. Once\nbound, you can call the variable like a named function.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n### without funtions\n\n```nix\n{ ... }:\nlet\nin\n{\n    programs.newsboat = {\n        enable = true;\n        urls = [\n            {tags = [ \"articles\" ]; url = \"https://proton.me/blog/feed\";}\n            { # normal way \n                tags = [ \"youtube\" \"music\" ];\n                url = \"https://rsshub.app/youtube/user/@JFlaMusic\";\n            }\n            { \n                tags = [ \"youtube\" \"movies\" ];\n                url = \"https://rsshub.app/youtube/user/@DanMurrellMovies\";\n            }\n            { \n                tags = [ \"youtube\" \"programming\" ];\n                url = \"https://rsshub.app/youtube/user/@jonhoo\";\n            }\n            { \n                tags = [ \"youtube\" \"programming\" ];\n                url = \"https://rsshub.app/youtube/user/@ThePrimeagen\";\n            }\n            # and so on...\n        ]\n    };\n}\n```\n\n### with funtions\n\n```nix\n{ ... }:\nlet\n    Youtube = userName: tags: {\n        tags = tags;\n        url = \"https://rsshub.app/youtube/user/@${userName}\";\n    };\nin\n    {\n    programs.newsboat = {\n        enable = true;\n        urls = [\n            {tags = [ \"articles\" ]; url = \"https://proton.me/blog/feed\";}\n            (Youtube \"JFlaMusic\" [ \"youtube\" \"music\" ])\n            (Youtube \"DanMurrellMovies\" [ \"youtube\" \"movies\" ])\n            (Youtube \"jonhoo\" [ \"youtube\" \"programming\" ])\n            (Youtube \"ThePrimeagen\" [ \"youtube\" \"programming\" ])\n            # and so on...\n        ]\n    };\n}\n```\n\nThis approach is much cleaner and simplifies debugging in the future. If the API\nfor RSS changes, you only need to update a single line in the function\ndefinition, rather than rewriting all the occurrences.\n\n# Final code\n\n```nix\n{ ... }:\nlet\ninstagramFeeds = users: map ( userNames: {\n    tags = [ \"instagram\" ];\n    url = \"https://rsshub.app/picuki/profile/${userNames}\";\n    }) users;\ntwitterFeeds = users: map ( userNames: {\n    tags = [ \"twitter\" ];\n    url = \"https://nitter.privacydev.net/${userNames}/rss\";\n    }) users;\nredditFeeds = users: map ( userNames: {\n    tags = [ \"reddit\" ];\n    url = \"https://www.reddit.com/r/${userNames}.rss\";\n    }) users;\nyouTubeFeeds = users: map ( userNames: {\n    tags = [ \"youtube\" ];\n    url = \"https://rsshub.app/youtube/user/@${userNames}\";\n    }) users;\nYoutube = userName: tags: {\n  tags = tags;\n  url = \"https://rsshub.app/youtube/user/@${userName}\";\n};\nYoutubeId = channel_id: tags: {\n  tags = tags;\n  url = \"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=${channel_id}\";\n};\nYtMusicChart = category: countryCode: tags: {\n  tags = tags;\n  url = \"https://rsshub.app/youtube/charts/${category}/${countryCode}/RightNow\";\n};\nSpotify = category: name: id: {\n  tags = [ \"music\" ];\n  url = \"https://rsshub.app/spotify/${category}/${id}\";\n};\nin \n{\n  programs.newsboat = {\n    enable = true;\n    browser = \"linkhandler\";\n    autoReload = false;\n    urls = [\n      {tags = [ \"articles\" ]; url = \"https://feeds.feedburner.com/collabfund\";}\n      (Youtube \"CinemaStellar\" [ \"youtube\" \"movies\" ])\n      (Youtube \"DanMurrellMovies\" [ \"youtube\" \"movies\" ])\n      (YoutubeId \"UC7YOGHUfC1Tb6E4pudI9STA\" [])\n      (YoutubeId \"UCP7WmQ_U4GB3K51Od9QvM0w\" [])\n      (YtMusicChart \"TopSongs\" \"in\" [ \"YtMusic\" ])\n      (Spotify \"playlist\" \"Top Songs - Global\" \"37i9dQZEVXbNG2KDcFcKOF\")\n      (Spotify \"playlist\" \"Top Songs - India\" \"37i9dQZEVXbMWDif5SCBJq\")\n      (Spotify \"artist\" \"Halsey\"            \"26VFTg2z8YR0cCuwLzESi2\")\n      (Spotify \"artist\" \"The Chainsmokers\"  \"69GGBxA162lTqCwzJG5jLp\")\n      ]\n      ++ youTubeFeeds [\n        \"jonhoo\"\n        \"LukeSmithxyz\"\n        \"NoBoilerplate\"\n        ]\n        ++ twitterFeeds [\n          \"jonhoo\"\n          \"MikaPikaZo\"\n        ]\n        ++ redditFeeds [\n          \"rust\"\n          \"nixos\"\n          \"unixporn\"\n        ]\n        ++ instagramFeeds [\n          \"kartikaaryan\"\n        ];\n\n    extraConfig = ''\n      bind-key j down\n      bind-key k up\n      '';\n  };\n}\n```",

      "content_html": "Congrats! You’ve finally bought yourself a domain, and now you're ready to\nconnect it to your GitHub Pages website. This guide will walk you through the\nsteps to set up your GoDaddy domain with GitHub Pages.\n\n# Step 1: Configuring GitHub Pages\n\nFirst, ensure that your repository name follows the required naming convention\nfor GitHub Pages ie, your repository name must be your-username.github.io.\n\nmine is: https://github.com/abhi-xyz/abhi-xyz.github.io\n\nOnce your repository is ready, navigate to the repository’s Settings.\n\n## Enable GitHub Pages\n\n1. Go to the Settings of your repository.\n2. Scroll down to the Code and Automation section and select Pages.\n3. Under Source, choose the branch that contains your static site. For most\n   cases, this will be the main or master branch.\n4. For the directory, choose root (ie, the directory which the index.html is\n   situated).\n5. Save the changes, and GitHub will start serving your site from\n   your-username.github.io.\n\n# Step 2: Setting Up DNS Records in GoDaddy\n\nNow that your GitHub Pages site is live, the next step is to point your custom\nGoDaddy domain to GitHub Pages.\n\n## Add DNS Records in GoDaddy\n\n1. Log in to your [GoDaddy account](https://www.godaddy.com/).\n2. Under **My Products**, find your domain and click DNS to manage its DNS\n   settings.\n3. Add the following entries in the DNS management settings:\n\n![add these entries in GoDaddy's DNS management settings](/static/articles/how-to-set-up-GoDaddy-domain-with-gitHub-pages/01-godaddy-dns-management.avif)\n\n- Type: A\n- Name: @\n- Value: 185.199.108.153 (Values might change so refer this\n  [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain)\n  and put aprropriate values.)\n\n(Repeat this for all four IPs: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153,\n185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153)\n\n- TTL: 600 seconds (default is fine)\n\n4. Add a CNAME record as well: (optional if you want to set www with\n   yourdomain.com. ie, www.yourdomain.com)\n\n- Type: CNAME\n- Name: www\n- Value: your-username.github.io\n- TTL: 600 seconds\n\nSave the changes.\n\n# Step 3: Configuring a Custom Domain in GitHub Pages\n\nOnce you’ve set up the DNS records in GoDaddy, go back to your GitHub\nrepository.\n\nHead to Settings > Pages.\n\n![github-pages](/static/articles/how-to-set-up-GoDaddy-domain-with-gitHub-pages/01-github-pages.avif)\n\nScroll down to the Custom Domain section.\n\n![github-pages settings](/static/articles/how-to-set-up-GoDaddy-domain-with-gitHub-pages/01-github-pages-settings.avif)\n\nEnter your GoDaddy domain (e.g., yourdomain.com) in the field. GitHub will\nautomatically create a CNAME file in the root directory of your repository. This\nfile tells GitHub that your website is linked to this custom domain.\n\n![generated CNAME file in root](/static/articles/how-to-set-up-GoDaddy-domain-with-gitHub-pages/01-docs-folder.avif)\n\nAfter adding the domain, GitHub Pages will take a few minutes to process the\nchanges.\n\n# Step 4: Check SSL/TLS and HTTPS\n\nAfter configuring your custom domain, it's crucial to ensure that your website\nis served securely over HTTPS. GitHub Pages offers built-in support for HTTPS\nthrough Let's Encrypt, which is a major advantage over traditional domain\nproviders like GoDaddy.\n\n1. Go to your repository's Settings.\n2. In the GitHub Pages section, look for the option to Enforce HTTPS.\n3. Enable the Enforce HTTPS checkbox. This will ensure that visitors are\n   automatically redirected to the secure version (HTTPS) of your site.\n\nHowever, after adding your domain, you may encounter a message saying, \"TLS\ncertificate is being provisioned\". This is completely normal and indicates that\nGitHub is working with Let's Encrypt to issue your SSL certificate. You may need\nto refresh the page after some time if the Enforce HTTPS option is disabled at\nfirst.\n\n![TLS certificate provisioned](/static/articles/how-to-set-up-GoDaddy-domain-with-gitHub-pages/tls_provisioned.avif)\n\n## Why HTTPS Matters\n\nNormally, domains purchased from GoDaddy or other providers are routed through\nHTTP by default, which means your site won't be secure. When someone visits your\nsite, their browser will display a warning indicating that the site is not\nsecure, which can drive away visitors.\n\nIf you were to purchase a SSL certificate from GoDaddy, it could cost you\napproximately ₹4999 annually. However, by using GitHub Pages, you get a free TLS\ncertificate through Let's Encrypt, giving you secure, encrypted access to your\nwebsite without additional costs. This is one of the key benefits of using\nGitHub Pages for hosting!\n\nOnce the DNS settings propagate (which may take between 24-48 hours), your\nGitHub Pages site will be securely accessible through your custom GoDaddy domain\nover HTTPS.\n\nThat’s it! You've successfully set up your GoDaddy domain with GitHub Pages. 🎉\nEnjoy your new, secure website!",
